/--
Bounds for the various fixed-fuel loops inside the kernel.

Every field is a positive `Nat`; on exhaustion the corresponding loop throws
`.deterministicTimeout` (whnf-family) or `.deepRecursion` (structural /
mutual-recursion loops).

Defaults are set so mathlib passes. Since lean4#13956 the native kernel bounds
its mutually recursive type-checker entry points using `maxRecDepth`.
Lean4lean instead keeps separate, explicit fuel for those calls and for loops
that need structural termination witnesses; these counters also provide a
deterministic defensive check against runaway reductions.

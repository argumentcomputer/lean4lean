# L4L-09A: nested-inductive representation audit and decision

This file is the committed design note and the executable metadata probes
for the nested-inductive representation decision.  Every claim below is
pinned by a build-failing probe in this file unless it is explicitly marked
as a forward-looking obligation.  This checkpoint changes no acceptance
behavior: the probes only observe the implementation and the existing
Theory analyzers.

## Audit: how the implementation represents nested inductives

`Environment.addInductive` (Inductive/Add.lean) runs three phases:

1. `ElimNestedInductive.run` rewrites the source declaration into a
   flattened mutual block: every nested occurrence `I Ds is` whose
   parametric arguments `Ds` mention a block family is replaced by
   `auxI As is`, where `auxI` is a fresh auxiliary family abstracted over
   the block parameters `As`, and one auxiliary family is created for each
   family of `I`'s mutual block, with constructor types instantiated at
   `Ds` (recursively rewritten).  `aux2nested` records `auxI ↦ I Ds`, open
   over the block parameters.  Auxiliary names are uniquified against the
   ambient environment (`mkUniqueName`).
2. `AddInductive.run` checks and generates the flattened block as an
   ordinary mutual block, receiving `numNested` (the number of auxiliary
   families) as opaque metadata.
3. When `numNested ≠ 0`, a restoration pass rebuilds the final environment
   from the *pre-block* environment: source families and constructors are
   re-added with every auxiliary constant replaced by its nested
   restoration (`Result.restoreNested`), each auxiliary family's recursor
   is re-added under the name `(mkRecName mainName).appendIndexAfter i`
   with restored type and rules, and finally every `aux2nested` value
   `I Ds` is type-checked (the lean4#14577 escape-hatch check, regression
   tested in `Tests/NestedInductive.lean`).  The auxiliary families,
   constructors, and recursor names never enter the final environment.

The stored metadata therefore has this shape (probes P1, P2):

- The source `inductInfo` keeps `all` = the source family names only and
  carries `numNested` = the number of auxiliary families; stored
  constructor types are in restored form (they mention `I Ds`, e.g.
  `List (RoseTree α)`).
- The recursor inventory is one recursor per source family plus one per
  auxiliary family, all with `all` = source names, and with
  `numMotives`/`numMinors` counting the *flattened* block's families and
  minors.  Auxiliary recursors have rules keyed by constructors of the
  previously declared nested inductive (`List.nil`, `List.cons`, ...) with
  `nfields` counting the instantiated auxiliary constructor's fields, and
  every rule RHS references the restored recursor constants mutually.
- No `_nested.*` constant, and no auxiliary recursor under its original
  name, survives into the final environment.

## Decision: additive artifact type; `VInductDecl` unchanged

The stored Theory payload for a nested declaration must be the *source*
`VInductDecl` (restored form), because that is what the implementation
stores and what Verify alignment must replay.  Storing the flattened block
is unrepresentable: the final `ConstMap` contains neither the auxiliary
families nor their constructors (probe P2), and the stored constructor
types differ from the flattened ones (probe P1).  `VInductDecl` needs no
new field: `numNested` is implementation metadata recoverable as the
number of auxiliary specifications, and parity fixtures pin it per row
exactly as they already pin `numNested == 0` for non-nested rows.

Nested support is an additive checked-block artifact (built in L4L-09B/C),
coupling:

1. the flattened block as an ordinary `VInductDecl` — probe P4 shows both
   target fixtures' flattened blocks are already accepted by the existing
   `identityBlockGeneration?` machinery, so flattening reuses the complete
   L4L-08 block analyzer and generator unchanged;
2. one auxiliary specification per auxiliary family, in flattened family
   order: the auxiliary name, the nested value `I Ds` open over the block
   parameters (the Theory analog of `aux2nested`), and the restored
   recursor name — plus executable coherence checks tying the flattened
   block to the source declaration and to the environment's metadata for
   `I` at `Ds`;
3. the restoration substitution σ, a structural constant substitution on
   `VExpr` (probe P5, `restoreV09A`): on an application spine headed by an
   auxiliary constant, the first `nparams` spine arguments are consumed
   and replaced by the instantiated value `I Ds`; auxiliary constructor
   constants are renamed by prefix into `I`'s constructors, applied to the
   instantiated value's own arguments; auxiliary recursor constants are
   renamed (checked *before* the constructor-prefix case, exactly like
   `restoreNested`'s `auxRec` map); levels come from the recorded value,
   not the auxiliary constant.

σ has one level-world subtlety (probe P5): specification values live in
declaration level-world, while recursor types and rules live in recursor
level-world, so σ over generation artifacts splices
`value.instL (VLevel.params' uvars elimOffset)`.  Constructor types are
restored with the unshifted value.  With that splice, σ over the flattened
block's existing `BlockGenerationChecked` artifacts reproduces the stored
kernel metadata *exactly* — every recursor type and every rule RHS of all
three probe fixtures — and no auxiliary constant survives the image.
Probe P2 additionally shows the port's full nested path reproduces Lean's
stored metadata field-for-field, and that the final metadata is
independent of auxiliary-name collisions (the uniquified names are erased
by σ), so Theory may choose canonical auxiliary names as artifact data.

Rejected alternatives:

- *Flattened block as stored payload*: contradicts the stored metadata
  (P1/P2); Verify alignment would have to invent constants the
  implementation never stores.
- *Changing `VInductDecl` fields*: unnecessary — the probes demonstrate
  the additive artifact expresses real rose-tree, nested-indexed, and
  constant-universe metadata; a payload change would ripple through every
  exported Theory API without demonstrated need.
- *A Prop-only pre-flattening relation without an artifact*: the
  specifications and σ are data consumed by generation and replay; a
  relation alone would force Verify to re-synthesize them.  The artifact's
  executable coherence checks subsume the relation.

## Obligations recorded for L4L-09B/09C (not claimed here)

- 09B: Theory-side flattening and auxiliary-specification validation —
  positivity through the existing block analyzer on the flattened block;
  executable instantiation checks of auxiliary family/constructor types
  against `I`'s metadata at `Ds`; nearest rejection differentials
  (ill-typed `Ds` — the lean4#14577 class — wrong specification order,
  non-matching instantiation).
- 09C: σ as a total Theory function.  The spine rule needs a simultaneous
  `instantiateRev`-style multi-substitution for `nparams > 1`: iterating
  single `VExpr.inst` is wrong once parameter arguments mention bvars.
  Generation, preservation (typing transport along σ: auxiliary constants
  behave as definitions `auxI := λ As, I Ds`, so staged flattened-block WF
  transports to restored WF given environment lookup facts for `I`'s
  families and constructors), insertion order, and replay of real
  `Inductive.Add.run` output.
- The kernel's trailing `checkType (I Ds)` becomes a WF premise of the
  auxiliary specification, never a trusted escape hatch.

`RoseTree` is the universe-polymorphic rose tree through `List`; `NVTree`
nests through the locally declared indexed family `PVec` (indices spelled
with `Nat.zero`/`Nat.succ` to keep the probe dependency maps free of
notation instances); `CURose` nests `List` at a constant universe, so its
auxiliary constant carries no block level while the restored `List`
carries level `1` — the level-instantiation case σ must represent. -/

/-! ## P5: the restoration substitution σ

`restoreV09A` mirrors `ElimNestedInductive.Result.restoreNested` on
`VExpr`.  It is probe-local: the L4L-09C artifact path must define the
total Theory version (with a simultaneous parameter substitution once
`nparams > 1` is in scope; the probe fixtures have `nparams ≤ 1`, where
iterated `VExpr.inst` coincides with it). -/

# Consumer certificates for completed inductive blocks

`BlockGenerationCertificate` is the semantic input to the block transaction.
This module packages that input with one successful transaction and a
well-formed dependency environment, then exports the stable consequences a
consumer needs.  The package contains only Theory values and proofs: no
implementation metadata, checker state, or normalization execution crosses
this boundary.

In particular, `BlockCertificate.ruleClosure` derives the closed payload
required by the generated-pattern API from the registered, well-formed iota
rules in the completed environment.  A consumer therefore does not need a
second closedness assumption in order to use `IotaPat`.
